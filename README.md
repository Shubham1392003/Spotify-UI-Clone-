# 🎧 Spotify UI Clone 🎵

A stylish and responsive **front-end clone of Spotify’s web interface** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project replicates the layout and design of the official Spotify homepage — including the sidebar, playlist grid, and footer player — purely for **educational and practice purposes**.

  - `songs/Atif/`
